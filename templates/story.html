        Our Story
    </h1>

    <p style="line-height:1.9; color:#555; font-size:17px;">
        Yana’s Gallery began as a shared passion for creativity, art, and handmade craftsmanship.
        What started as small artistic experiments among friends slowly grew into a meaningful journey —
        a journey built on dedication, imagination, and the courage to turn passion into purpose.
    </p>

    <br><br>

    <p style="line-height:1.9; color:#555; font-size:17px;">
        At Yana’s Gallery, every creation is unique.
        From expressive canvas paintings to intricately designed Kundan and thread-work bangles,
        and hand-painted sarees that blend tradition with elegance —
        each piece is crafted carefully and exists as a single original creation.
    </p>

    <br><br>

    <h3 style="font-family:'Playfair Display', serif;">
        We do not mass-produce.<br>
        We do not duplicate emotions.<br>
        Every product is made only once.
    </h3>

    <br><br>

    <p style="line-height:1.9; color:#555; font-size:17px;">
        Because art is personal.
        Art carries emotion.
        And emotion cannot be copied.
    </p>

    <br><br>

    <p style="line-height:1.9; color:#555; font-size:17px;">
        Each creation tells its own story — made with patience, care, and intention.
        When you own a piece from Yana’s Gallery, you own something truly one of a kind.
    </p>

    <br><br>

    <p style="line-height:1.9; color:#555; font-size:17px;">
        This journey is not just about selling handmade creations.
        It is about celebrating originality, preserving emotion,
        and building something meaningful — together.
    </p>

    <br><br>

    <h3 style="font-family:'Playfair Display', serif;">
        And this is only the beginning.
