        <h1>Our Story</h1>

        <p>
            Yana’s Gallery began as a shared passion for creativity, art, and handmade craftsmanship.
            What started as small artistic experiments among friends slowly grew into a meaningful journey —
            a journey built on dedication and the courage to turn passion into purpose.
        </p>

        <p>
            At Yana’s Gallery, every creation is unique.
            From expressive canvas paintings to intricately designed Kundan and thread-work bangles,
            and hand-painted sarees that blend tradition with elegance —
            each piece is crafted carefully and exists as a single original creation.

        <h3>
            We do not mass-produce.<br>
            We do not duplicate emotions.<br>
            Every product is made only once.
        </h3>

        <p>
            Because art is personal.
            Art carries emotion.
            And emotion cannot be copied.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each creation tells its own story — made with patience, care, and intention.
            When you own a piece from Yana’s Gallery, you own something truly one of a kind.
        </p>

        <h3>And this is only the beginning.</h3>
